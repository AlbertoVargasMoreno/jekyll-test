# Jekyll step by step tutorial
this is my deployment, following the step by step tutorial on the docs of jekyll

---
I'm concerned, I followed the recommended setup in [blog.shahednasser.com][1], and I didn't get the expected outcome.
I'm just getting this README shown, what do I need to change to get the expected outcome?.

---
:thinking:
now is working, but I cannot go through the pages about, posts, etc
